  Objective 

    A vector application is portable to the platforms with which it
    compiles (ant build script).


  Solution set

    A common library of platform adaptation for vector is defined as a
    package named "platform" which is available through multiple JAR
    package files.  

    One platform package is made available to the vector runtime by
    the selection of a platform package JAR file in the java
    application Class Path.

  Implementation architecture

    There's two architectural strategies: one in which the API is in
    the platform package, and another in which the API is in the
    vector package.

    Discussion

      Ideally, the API would be in the vector package.  However this
      strategy has only one tactic (that can solve the problem), the
      interface and factory or tooling classes as in the case of
      vector Component and Component Tools.

      A singular interface strategy to platform adaptation would
      result in a vector interface factory class that calls
      constructors in a platform agnostic way with the unique name
      "platform.Classname".

      Therefore the the pure interface strategy necessarily
      degenerates to the mixed or dual strategy by dropping the
      factory class and presenting the "platform.Classname" to the
      library and applications for direct use.

    API platform

      The platform package implements vector package interfaces for
      operator classes like the graphics context, and presents common
      required geometric classes like Path, Rectangle and Ellipse.

    API vector

      The vector package is primarily a component scene graph for
      interactive applications.  A reasonable level of usability
      implies a dependence on the platform package as highlighted in
      the case of the Color and Font classes.

      The Color and Font classes are employed in an operational way.
      Without public or protected access to internal data fields, use
      is exclusive to method calls.  However, they are not purely
      operational because library code usage is dominated by the use
      of constructors for these classes.  A vector package interface
      is not a complete solution in this case.

      The Color and Font classes are not members of the same
      structural or architectural case as geometry classes.

      A collection of vector geometry classes will be adapted to each
      platform Path implementation.  This choice maximizes utility
      subject to platform options.

      The solution of the Path binding problem on the Android platform
      will require the adaptation class to replicate path data in
      memory.  Users of the android graphics Path class are unable to
      retrieve path data entered into the (native) API.
