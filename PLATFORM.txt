  Objective 

    The "javac" class path is a type proof system.

  Solution

    A common "platform" software package is available in multiple
    flavors.  Each platform class file archive supports type proving,
    or a runtime.

          Runtime                 Archive

          AWT                     vector-awt-X.Y.Z.jar
          Android                 vector-android-X.Y.Z.jar
          N/A (Portability Test)  vector-platform-X.Y.Z.jar


    The vector runtime class path is a combination of the vector
    library compiled to the platform, with the platform.

          Runtime                 Archive

          AWT                     vector-X.Y.Z.jar
          Android                 vector-X.Y.Z.jar
          N/A (Portability Test)  vector-X.Y.Z.jar


    An application class path requires the application compiled to a
    particular vector runtime class path.


  Design

    There's two architectural strategies: one in which the API is in
    the platform package, and another in which the API is in the
    vector package.

    Discussion

      Ideally, the API would be in the vector package.  However, this
      strategy has only one tactic: interfaces and factories.

      In such an approach, portable factory functions would call
      constructors using the portable class name "platform.Classname".

      The vector architecture drops the factory and presents the
      "platform.Classname" for direct use.

    API platform

      The platform package implements vector package interfaces for
      operator classes like the graphics context, and presents common
      required geometric classes like Path, Rectangle and Ellipse.

    API vector

      The vector package is primarily a component scene graph for
      interactive applications.  A reasonable level of convenience
      implies a dependence on the platform package as highlighted in
      the case of the Color and Font classes.

      The Color and Font classes are employed in an operational way.
      Without public or protected access to internal data fields, use
      is exclusive to method calls.  However, they are not purely
      operational because library code usage is dominated by the use
      of constructors for these classes.  A vector package interface
      is not a complete solution in this case.

      The Color and Font classes are not members of the same
      structural or architectural case as geometry classes.

      A collection of vector geometry classes will be adapted to each
      platform Path implementation.  This choice maximizes utility
      subject to platform options.

      The solution of the Path binding problem on the Android platform
      will require the adaptation class to replicate path data in
      memory.  Users of the android graphics Path class are unable to
      retrieve path data entered into the (native) API.
