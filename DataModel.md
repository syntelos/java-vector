The [JSON](http://github.com/syntelos/json) format is convenient to machine readable channels, while other languages solve different requirements.

An application may apply external data in a way that is reproduced in the scene graph, or not.  If not, alternative communication channels would be implemented to solve requirements.

The general form for scene sharing is reading and writing a scene graph in JSON via HTTP or XMPP.  The alternative is reading and writing data (format language) via HTTP or XMPP, or otherwise.
