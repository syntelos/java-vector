Development tool for FV3 integration and testing

The Android PLATFORM (in vector) will employ fv3, which has incomplete
status of its TTF font reader.  This tool will eventually display
fonts and glyphs in Hershey or TTF format.

It's possible that fv3 will be applied to the AWT platform as its font
and path support matures.  In this case, the vector platform Font and
Path would change dramatically.
