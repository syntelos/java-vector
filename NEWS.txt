* Cleared known incorrect dependencies from the vector package

  The AWT platform and vector packages remain in continuous
  development status: applications are not testable for portability.

  The future strategy for application portability and platform
  conformance is primarily compiler based: platforms and applications
  compile to correctness.

  In the case of an application, compilation against multiple packages
  validates correctness in portability.

  In the case of a platform, interfaces in the vector package will
  test method signatures.  Applications test platform fields and
  semantics by coverage.

  Type validation interfaces in the vector package include the
  following.

    src/vector/Context.java
    src/vector/Event.java
    src/vector/font/GlyphVector.java
    src/vector/geom/Dimension.java
    src/vector/geom/Ellipse.java
    src/vector/geom/Line.java
    src/vector/geom/Path.java
    src/vector/geom/Point.java
    src/vector/geom/Rectangle.java
    src/vector/geom/RoundRectangle.java
    src/vector/Image.java

  These types are employed for platform type validation, but are not
  necessarily useful for application programming (excepting Context,
  Event, GlyphVector and Image).  Most programming employs platform
  types directly.
