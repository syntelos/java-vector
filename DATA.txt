 Purpose

   The data package defines relationships among enum types for
   defining interaction APIs in the services package. (See
   ./SERVICES.txt).

 Enum lanugage convention

   The services and data packages propose a convention for two related
   kinds of enums.  One kind of enum is the enumeration of columns in
   a data table, and is described as a "data" enum.  Data enums
   include choice sets for values and menus.  The second kind of enum
   is the enumeration of an operator and its arguments -- a syntactic
   enum.

 Configuration

   The runtime class path includes archives with the resource

      /META-INF/services/vector.data.DataField

   which lists the data enum implementors of the vector.data.DataField
   interface.

 Programming

   The DataKind class is the primary context object for data service
   programming.
