Usage

 After logon, known contacts are displayed in a list.  Clicking one selects a chat contact.

 To chat with anyone in the contacts list, alternatively type

  @name: message

 To select the first contact found by identifier or logon, and send the message.

 This also works more informally as

  @name message

 Pressing 'ESC' raises and lowers the connection dialog.
