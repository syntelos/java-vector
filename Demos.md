The **vector** package test scripts are available as online demos launched via [webstart](http://www.java.com/).  These JNLPs are available from http://java-vector.googlecode.com/git/demo/

Launching one of these online via JNLP webstart is equivalent to launching from the command line in the source directory: the online scenes load URLs, and the command line scenes load files.
