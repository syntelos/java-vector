# In development #

The **vector** package provides scalable vector graphics programming for graphical user interfaces.  Scalable vector graphical user interfaces solve many problems, including mobile screen size deployment, or desktop visualization density.

  * Declarative application UI construction and publishing via JSON

  * Auto - scaling **vector** applications compile to multiple **platform** runtimes

  * Java platform AWT exists

  * Java platform planned for Android and JOGL

  * Browser platform planned for SVG and WebGL

# Status #

_Platform work in progress while master is stable._
_Widget work remaining._

# Quickstart #

Checkout [sources (master)](http://code.google.com/p/java-vector/source/checkout) with [git](http://git-scm.com/), change to directory, enter
```sh

./test.sh```
or follow the `<pattern>`
```sh

java -jar vector-demo-<version>.jar <file>.json```
to run through the JSON [examples](http://code.google.com/p/java-vector/source/browse/).  See [Overview](Overview.md), [Demos](Demos.md) or [Programming](Programming.md) for more info.
