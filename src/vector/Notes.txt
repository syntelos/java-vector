  Employing RFC 2119 style.

  http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119


Requirements

  1

    Scalable vector graphics paradigm resizes the window frame and content

    Scripting of static and dynamic window content 

  2

    Drag and drop window content among multiple windows on screen

    Teleview window content via XMPP

  3

    Tabbed window for multiple content panes

  4

    Plot static and dynamic data via original import/export data sets

  5

    Media (e.g. JSON) define and update window content as a tree of named components

    Update deltas modify subtree components by specifying ancestors by name, not content

    Component names are array indeces from zero inclusive.


Imports

  A number of concepts are imported from previous work 

  * Input coordinate space differs from the output coordinate space

    * A menu bar or display containers will be included in the input space but excluded from the output space

  * The drawing of a component should not clip to the component

    * A component should be free to not define its boundaries

    * A component should be free to draw beyond its boundaries

      * For example borders decoration or content rotation

  * A coordinate local transform should be independent of the component parent transform

    * A component should be free to choose its internal transform/input/output strategy

  * Feature implementation should be defined via subclasses rather than enums

    * Feature definition via enum proposes an unmanageable and impractical application space 

  * Input events should be passed to a component as translated to its local coordinate space

    * Natural pattern
